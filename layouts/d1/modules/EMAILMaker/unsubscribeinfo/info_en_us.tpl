    <li>$user_name – this is the username you use to login to the vtiger CRM, see also “My Preferences”</li>
    <li>$user_access_key – the access key can be retrieved by logging into your vtiger CRM account, going to "My Preferences"</li>

</p>
<ul>

    <li>parameter 4 – Text of the unsubscribe link</li>
</ul>
